# Food Deserts in Northern California

For our first project, we explored food desert data in Northern California.

Each participant has their own folder with their code and outputs if that is something you'd like to check. (PSC=Payson, MKL=Mina, Drea Project=Vandrea) The presentation and analysis was worked on by all participants. We did have to split up maps into two notebook because the map files can be quite big when it includes figures. All outputs should be in the out put folder, but again, if there are any issues, please check our respective folders.

One resource was too big of a file to upload. Find it here... (https://www.ers.usda.gov/data-products/food-access-research-atlas/download-the-data/)
