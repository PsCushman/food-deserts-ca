# project-1

For our first project, we explored food desert data in Northern California.

Each participant has their own folder with their code and outputs. (PSC=Payson, MKL=Mina, Drea Project=Vandrea) The presentation and analysis was worked on by all participants.

One resource was too big of a file to upload. Find it here... (https://www.ers.usda.gov/data-products/food-access-research-atlas/download-the-data/)
